  Dot HQ <i>(dothq.co)</i>
</h1>

Welcome to the Dot HQ Web Stack. Our web pages are in `pages/`, the assets are at `src/images`, fonts are at `src/fonts` and the API is at `api`.

_Have an idea for our website? You can drop a suggestion in our [Discord server](https://invite.gg/dot) or [create an issue in this repo](/issues/new)._

## ðŸš€ Running web locally

1.  **Clone the repo**

    If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed, this should be an easy task.

    ```shell
    # cloning our repo...
    git clone https://git.dothq.co/dothq.co.git
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies**

    We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of [npm](https://npm.im), as npm causes issues with Gatsby.

    ```shell
    cd dothq.co
    yarn
    ```
   
1.  **Run the development server**

    Once all the dependencies have installed without errors, run the following commands in your terminal.

    ```shell
    # Developing the frontend
    yarn develop:web

    # Developing the api
    yarn develop:api
    ```

1.  **Start hacking**

    You should see a message in the terminal like this:

    ```
    You can now view dothq.co in the browser.
    â €
      http://localhost:8000/
    â €
    View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema
    â €
      http://localhost:8000/___graphql
    â €
    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use gatsby build
    ```

    The site is now running and you can visit in your browser of choice *(hopefully [Dot Browser](https://github.com/dothq/browser))* at `localhost:8000/`. If the port is different in the above message, you can substitute `:8000` for what it says above.
 

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
